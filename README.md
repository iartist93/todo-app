# TODO App

- I started this app from scratch as a simple exercise in one of my Udacity react sessions meetings, then I got inspired to continue working on it and add more features to see how far I can go with it.
- I don't used any framework or library, just Vanilla-JS and redux (will be replaced soon with my [custom redux implementation](https://github.com/iartist93/custom-redux)) for state managment.
